  utter_nep_intro:

      making way for large scale, transformational reforms in both school and higher
      education sectors.
  utter_nep_history:

      NEP came under the Prime Ministership of Indira Gandhi. In 1986, the second

  utter_nep_why:
  - text: ': New Policy aims for Universalization of Education from pre-school to
      secondary level with 100 % GER in school education by 2030 Policy aims to transform
      India into a vibrant knowledge society. The Policy focuses on making India global
      knowledge superpower by making both school and college education more holistic,
      flexible, multidisciplinary, suited to 21st century needs. Ultimately the reforms
      are aimed at bringing out the unique capabilities of each student. '

  - text: 'School education - The new NEP focuses on overhauling the curriculum and
      easier Board exams. It also focused on a reduction in the syllabus to retain
      core essentials and thrust on experiential learning and critical thinking. It
      pitches for a “5+3+3+4” design of school education in the place of a “10+2”
      structure. This design will be corresponding to age groups 3-8 years (foundational
      stage), 8-11 (preparatory), 11-14 (middle), and 14-18 (secondary). This brings
      early childhood education (pre-school education for children of ages 3 to 5)
      under the ambit of formal schooling. The mid-day meal programme will be extended
      to pre-school children. The NEP says students until Class 5 should be taught
      in their mother tongue or regional language. Higher education - The NEP proposes
      to open up Indian higher education to foreign universities. It proposes to dismantle
      the UGC and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). It proposes
      to introduce a 4-year multidisciplinary UG programme with multiple exit options,
      and discontinuation of the M Phil programme. It also proposes phasing out of
      all institutions offering single streams. It says that all universities and
      colleges must aim to become multidisciplinary by 2040. '

      be able to set up campuses in India. The government may use the ‘QS World University

  utter_nep_bachelor:
  - text: 'Under this proposed 4-year programme, students can exit, • After one year
      with a certificate, • After two years with a diploma, and • After three years
      with a bachelor’s degree. • Four-year bachelor’s programmes generally include
      a certain amount of research work. Therefore, the student will get deeper knowledge
      in the subject s/he decides to major in. After four years, a UG student could
      enter a research degree programme directly depending on how well s/he has performed.
      However, master’s degree programmes will continue to function as they do, following
      which student may do a PhD. '
  utter_nep_mphill:
  - text: 'This would not affect the higher education trajectory at all. In normal
      course, after a master’s degree a student can register for a PhD programme.
      This is the current practice almost all over the world. In most universities,
      M Phil was a middle research degree between a master’s and a PhD. MPhil degrees
      have slowly been phased out in favour of a direct PhD programme. '
  utter_nep_uniqueness:
  - text: 'MHRD has been renamed as Ministry of Education Higher Education Commission
      of India (HECI) will be set up as a single umbrella body for the entire higher
      education, excluding medical and legal education. HECI will be having four independent
      verticals namely, • National Higher Education Regulatory Council (NHERC) for
      regulation, • General Education Council (GEC) for standard setting, • Higher
      Education Grants Council (HEGC) for funding, • National Accreditation Council
      (NAC) for accreditation. '
